# About Me

Hi! My name is **Fidel Boamah**, I am an *interactive designer* and a *mixed media artist* who was born and raised in Accra, Ghana. I am currently based in Philadelphia, PA, attending Drexel University where I am pursuing a B.S in **Interactive Digital Media.**

As a mixed media artist I dabble in all sorts of things including:
 1. Photography
 2. Web development
 3. Graphic design
 4. Music
 5. Drawing etc.

>I do all these creative things because I am an artist at heart, I feel most content when I am in the studio creating work that will positively impact lives.  

Aside my art, which keeps me satisfied, **money** is a huge motivation for me. I developed fundamental forex trading skills to help sustain myself in trying times and often embark on small scale projects for local businesses.

I am also a **marketer**. I have been involved in work that revolves around digital marketing, specifically social media marketing, search engine optimization and branding. My peers always point out that I am doing the most but Iâ€™m really just trying to survive in these streets.
